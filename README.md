# Just Snake 
A simple snake game made with Python and [Pygame](https://pyga.me/) library, Inspired by the [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) style (font, palette, resolution ...)

(this is my first time making something without tutorials, just docs and some help from AI)

## Requirements
* Python 3 (I am using python 3.12.3) 

* Pygame library (I am using pygame-ce 2.5.5)
```bash
pip install pygame-ce
```

## Setup
just run the main.py file
```python
python3 main.py
```

if you are on Linux and this error appeared while installing pygame:
```bash
error: externally-managed-environment
```
try using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Controls
Arrow keys => Movement

Space => Pause

Escape => Exit

F => Fullscreen
